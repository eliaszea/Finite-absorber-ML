Datasets, models, and results for the paper "Sound absorption estimation of finite porous samples with deep residual learning"

**1. INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains the datasets, models, and associated results in the paper "Sound absorption estimation of finite porous samples with deep residual learning" by Zea et al. (2023). 

finite-absorber-ML is covered by a GPL v3 license (see LICENSE for license terms).

**2. INSTALLATION**

The models and the datasets are required to run the main script to reproduce the results. For this, the folder `dependencies` must be in the same directory as the main script.
